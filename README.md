# Neovim API playground

A playground for testing and exploring the Neovim APIs. Any `.lua` files within `/lua` directory can be and will be executed via `./run.sh` unless otherwise `init.lua` is modified. `playground.lua` is enough to get started.

`init.lua`: minimal entrypoint for the neovim API playground. It will download `plenary` package for later use.

```bash
./run.sh
```
